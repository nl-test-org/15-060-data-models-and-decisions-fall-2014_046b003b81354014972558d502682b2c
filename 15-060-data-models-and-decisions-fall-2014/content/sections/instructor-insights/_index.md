Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _15.060 Data, Models, and Decisions_ as it was taught by Professors Robert Freund, Juan Pablo Vielma and Cynthia Rudin in Fall 2014.

This course introduces first-year Sloan master’s students to the fundamental tools and techniques of using data to make informed management decisions. It covers introductory probability, decision analysis, basic statistics, regression, simulation, linear and nonlinear optimization, and discrete optimization. Students study computer spreadsheet exercises, cases, and examples drawn from marketing, finance, operations management, and other management functions.

*   Recitations met 1 time per week for 1 hour per session; optional attendance.
*   Some lecture sessions were didactic, others relied heavily upon interactive discussion within the class, as well as cold-calling, especially when discussing case studies.
*   Recitation periods were used to review and reinforce material covered in the lectures, and to review the ins and outs of using modeling software for the course. Recitations were run by the Teaching Assistants.

Out of Class
------------

Students prepared readings, team and individual cases and write-ups, individual homework assignments, and studied for exams outside of class.
